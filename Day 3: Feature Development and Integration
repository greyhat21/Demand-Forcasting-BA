## Day 3: Feature Development and Integration

### Business Analyst
- Finalize user stories for first 3 KPIs (sales trends, demand forecasts, inventory turnover).
- Collaborate with Frontend Developer to ensure dashboard wireframe aligns with user stories.
- Review Backend Developer’s API endpoint documentation and provide feedback.
- Begin drafting test cases for user acceptance testing (UAT) of dashboard and forecasts.
- Research retail-specific KPIs (e.g., forecast accuracy metrics) to propose additional features.

### Frontend Developer (ReactJS)
- Connect dashboard to Backend Developer’s `/api/sales` endpoint to fetch real sales data.
- Implement state management (e.g., React hooks) for dynamic KPI updates.
- Style KPI widgets with Tailwind CSS for consistent branding (e.g., retail-themed colors).
- Add loading states and error handling for API calls in the dashboard.
- Test dashboard responsiveness across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### Backend Developer (Python/ML)
- Implement data preprocessing pipeline (e.g., handle missing values, normalize data).
- Train initial ML model (e.g., Random Forest) on historical sales data for demand forecasting.
- Create API endpoint for forecast data (e.g., `/api/forecast?product_id=123`).
- Test API endpoints with Postman to ensure correct data output.
- Share forecast model performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) with BA for validation.
