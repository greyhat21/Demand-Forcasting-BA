## Day 2: Requirements Refinement and Initial Development

### Business Analyst
- Refine user stories with acceptance criteria (e.g., “Dashboard displays sales trends for the last 30 days with <2s load time”).
- Meet with Backend Developer to finalize data schema for KPIs (e.g., sales by date, product category).
- Update wireframe based on Frontend Developer’s feedback.
- Begin drafting API documentation outline (e.g., endpoints for sales data, forecasts).
- Share initial user stories with team for review during standup.

### Frontend Developer (ReactJS)
- Implement reusable React components for KPI widgets (e.g., `SalesTrendChart`, `InventoryTurnoverCard`).
- Integrate Chart.js (via CDN) for visualizing sales trends in the dashboard.
- Mock API calls with dummy data to render placeholder charts (e.g., line chart for sales).
- Ensure dashboard is responsive using Tailwind CSS (mobile and desktop layouts).
- Test initial UI components locally and push updates to Git.

### Backend Developer (Python/ML)
- Design database schema for sales and inventory data (e.g., tables for transactions, products).
- Create API endpoint to fetch historical sales data (e.g., `/api/sales?start_date=YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Begin exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sample dataset to identify patterns (e.g., seasonality).
- Select initial ML model (e.g., ARIMA or Random Forest) for forecasting based on data characteristics.
- Document API endpoint details and share with BA for documentation.
