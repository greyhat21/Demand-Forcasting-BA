# Daily Tasks for Sales Forecasting Product Development (Week 1)

## Day 1: Project Kickoff and Setup

### Business Analyst
- Meet with stakeholders to confirm project scope: dashboard with KPIs (sales trends, demand forecasts, inventory turnover) and ML-based backend.
- Draft initial user stories for MVP (e.g., "As a retail manager, I want to see daily sales trends to plan inventory").
- Create wireframe for dashboard layout using Figma or a similar tool (focus on KPI widgets).
- Document data requirements (e.g., sales, inventory, external factors) and share with Backend Developer.
- Schedule daily standup meeting (15 minutes) for team alignment.

### Frontend Developer (ReactJS)
- Set up React project using CDN-hosted libraries (React, ReactDOM, Tailwind CSS).
- Create a basic project structure with index.html, App.jsx, and components folder.
- Initialize version control (Git) and push initial commit to shared repository.
- Build a static dashboard template with placeholder KPI widgets (e.g., line chart for sales trends).
- Review BA’s wireframe and provide feedback on feasibility.

### Backend Developer (Python/ML)
- Set up Python environment with Flask/FastAPI for REST API and scikit-learn/TensorFlow for ML.
- Initialize database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and connect to backend for sample data access.
- Review BA’s data requirements and confirm available datasets (e.g., historical sales, inventory).
- Create a basic API endpoint (e.g., `/health`) to test connectivity with frontend.
- Set up Git repository and align with Frontend Developer for shared version control.
