## Day 4: Testing and Refinement

### Business Analyst
- Review dashboard prototype with stakeholders and gather feedback on KPI presentation.
- Update user stories based on stakeholder feedback (e.g., add filters for date ranges).
- Finalize API documentation with Backend Developerâ€™s input.
- Begin planning sprint review meeting for end of week.
- Assist Frontend Developer in mapping test cases to UI components.

### Frontend Developer (ReactJS)
- Fix bugs from initial API integration (e.g., handle null data gracefully).
- Implement date range filters for KPIs (e.g., dropdown for selecting time periods).
- Optimize dashboard performance (e.g., memoize expensive chart renders).
- Write unit tests for React components using Jest (via CDN).
- Push updated dashboard code to Git and demo to BA during standup.

### Backend Developer (Python/ML)
- Optimize ML model based on initial performance (e.g., tune hyperparameters).
- Add error handling to API endpoints (e.g., return 400 for invalid requests).
- Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed sales data to improve API performance.
- Write unit tests for API endpoints using pytest.
- Share updated forecast accuracy metrics with BA and discuss improvements.
